# Project 2 - Movie Browser
In this project, you'll build a Movie Browser app that allows users to search for movies from the Open Movie Database (OMDb: http://www.omdbapi.com/) and view detailed information about selected movies. This app will give you practice with navigation, API integration, and UI design. Check out the staff solution for inspiration.

# Requirements (2025)
Use the following libraries:
expo: https://expo.dev/
react: https://reactjs.org/
react-native: https://reactnative.dev/
react-native-screens: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-screens
react-navigation (latest version, using @react-navigation/native-stack for stack navigation): https://reactnavigation.org/
prop-types: https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types
Any library for icons, such as react-native-vector-icons: https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons
Functional Features:
Implement at least one Stack.Navigator to manage navigation between screens.
Include a Search Screen:
Allow users to search for movies by title.
Display results in a scrollable list (load more than 10 results if available).
Include a Details Screen:
Display additional information (e.g., title, plot, release year, poster, etc.) about the selected movie.
Aesthetics:
The design and layout of the app are up to you, but it should be visually appealing and user-friendly.
# Optional Challenge
Add pagination to load search results dynamically as the user scrolls.
Allow users to save favorite movies and view them in a separate screen.
